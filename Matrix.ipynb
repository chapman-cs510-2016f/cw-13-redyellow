It is a template class, which allows an arbitrary type T to be passed into a class as a parameter, so a single class definition can apply to different types.  The private part of this template class Matrix includes a matrix mat (a vector of vectors, each storing type T), and numbers of rows and columns (two dimentional). The public part of this template class Matrix defines methods, which includes constructor, functions of Rule of Three(copy-constructor, destructor, and assignment), access methods, and operator + between matrices.\n",
